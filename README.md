# HTML and CSS Challenges for beginners

I built a few challenges for people to try to replicate in order to make the first steps with coding in css and html.

#### Disclaimer

All excersizes are just off the top of my head and may not teach the best practices. This can be neglected, as it is more important to just get in front of the keyboard and try to solve really _any_ challenge. Googeling the best practices later on, is easy todo, however The first challenge is to break that mental block and start c.o.d.i.n.g.

#### Get Started

- Download and open any of the HTML files in your browser
- Visit codepen.io or (any competitor) and replicate
- If you get stuck, try to solve it alone first
- When you feel tired and frustrated, look into the sourcecode of the file and adapt your code
- Memorize the missing piece and try to build the challenge again from scratch
